        <h4>Renowed Author Who's Magic change the world!!</h4>
          <p>
              Discovering the world of <b>Harry Potter</b> as a child in the 90's changed my life. For the first time, I realized that I could escape my reality by just reading a book. 
                I felt what the characters felt. I experienced Harry's excitement when he rode on the Hogwarts Express for the first time, and I still feel that excitement when I return to these stories, twenty years later.</p>
        <p>
            In 1993, before the world had heard of Harry Potter, and before his creator became a household name and billionaire, J.K. Rowling was living on welfare as a single parent suffering from clinical depression. 
            In the preceding years, she had endured her mother's death, a miscarriage, and separation from her husband. Despite feeling very much like a failure, Rowling continued to write. She developed Harry Potter's magical world while writing in cafes, with her sleeping infant daughter beside her. When she finished and tried to publish her first book, twelve publishing companies rejected her manuscript. 
            An editor from Bloomsbury in London finally offered to publish her work, giving her an advance of &#163;1,500, the equivalent of a little over $2,000. In addition to this advance, Rowling was also given the advice to "not quit her day job."</p>

        <p>Today, most people have heard of Rowling and her seven <em>Harry Potter</em> books, which have been translated into 68 languages and have sold more than 400 million copies. The books were also made into eight different movies, three amusement parks, and a franchise whose worth is difficult to determine - but which is estimated to be around $25 billion. 
            Far from her days of being on welfare, Rowling's net worth is a little under $1 billion. She was dropped from "Forbes' Billionaire List" in 2012 due to her charitable contributions.</p>
        <p>Rowling has not only ignited the imagination of children and adults worldwide with her story-telling, but has also inspired countless dreamers to pursue their passions with her own story of perseverance in the face of adversity. 
            In 2008, Rowling famously delivered the commencement speech at Harvard University, encouraging the graduates to embrace one of the qualities that she had found essential to finding success and a life worth living: failure. And if even one person is able to climb so high after falling so far, then surely this feat is a possibility for all of us.</p>

            <h3>"You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default."
